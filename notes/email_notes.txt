5321.MailFrom address - MAIL FROM, P1 sender, envelope sender
5322.From address - From address, P2 sender

Authentication-Results
    spf=<pass (IP address)|fail (IP address)|softfail (reason)|neutral|none|temperror|permerror> smtp.mailfrom=<domain>
        pass (IP address): passed - client authorized to send or relay email on behalf of the sender's domain
        fail (IP address): failed, sometimes called hard fail
        softfail (reason): host not allowed to send, but in transition
        neutral: record explicitly states it does not assert whether IP address is authorized to send
        none: domain has no SPF record or SPF record doesn't evaluate to a result
        temperror: temporary error occurred, same check later may succeed - NDS error, etc
        permerror: permanent error occurred - domain has a badly formatted SPF record, etc
        smtp.mailfrom: domain of the 5321.MailFrom address - used for Non-Delivery Reports (NDR) or bounces

    dkim=<pass|fail (reason)|none> header.d=<domain>
        pass: DKIM check passed
        fail (reason): DKIM check failed
        none: message was not signed
        header.d: domain from DKIM signature, queried for public key

    dmarc=<pass|fail|bestguesspass|none> action=<permerror|temperror|oreject|pct.quarantine|pct.reject> header.from=<domain>
        pass: DMARC check passed
        fail: DMARC check failed
        bestguesspass: no domain DMARC TXT record exists, if one had, DMARC check would have passed - domain in the 5321.MailFrom address matches domain in the 5322.From address
        none: no DMARC TXT record exists for the sending domain
        action
            oreject or o.reject: override reject - message fails DMARC check from a domain whose DMARC TXT record has a policy of p=reject, message marked as spam
            pct.quarantine: message failed DMARC, policy set to quarantine, pct field not set to 100% - system randomly decided not to apply DMARC action, per domain policy
            pct.reject: message failed DMARC, policy set to reject, pct field not set to 100% - system randomly decided not to apply DMARC action, per domain policy
            permerror: permanent error during DMARC evaluation, resend isn't likely to to result in different outcome
            temperror: temporary error during DMARC evaluation, resend may result in different outcome
        header.from: 5322.From address - recipient sees as from address

    reason (Nxx - xx used by Microsoft 365)
        000: failed explicit authentication (compauth=fail)
        001: failed implicit authentication (compauth=fail) - sending domain did not have email authentication records published, or they had a weaker failure policy (SPF soft fail or neutral, DMARC policy of p=none)
        002: policy for the sender/domain pair that is explicitly prohibited from sending spoofed email
        010: message failed DMARC with an action of reject or quarantine, sending domain is an accepted domain
        1xx or 7xx: passed authentication (compauth=pass)
        2xx: soft-passed implicit authentication (compauth=softpass)
        3xx: not checked for composite authentication (compauth=none)
        4xx or 9xx: bypassed composite authentication (compauth=none)
        6xx: failed implicit email authentication, sending domain is an accepted domain
